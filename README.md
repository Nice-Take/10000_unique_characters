## MetaFuzzies Project Recap ##

The goal of this project was to create 10,000
unique and attractive characters programatically.

Attributes were setup programmatically using 
Python inside of SideFx Houdini. 

An algorithm was developed to ensure that there
were no visible geometry collisions and that no
two characters could ever be identical.

This repo contains a few selections from the 
project as samples.

Thank you!
