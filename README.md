## Project Overview ##

### 10,000 unique and attractive characters programatically.

*This is only 100, but they would be a little too small with 10,000 stuffed into this image.*

![3D Geometry](https://github.com/Nice-Take/10000_unique_characters/blob/master/High_to_Low_Poly.jpg)
*Not only were 2D renders created but as part of the program low-poly 3D geometry was also produced.*


Attributes were designed algorithmically with Python and rendering/geometry was handled inside of SideFx Houdini with the use of the VEX programming language and Python.

An algorithm was developed to ensure that there
were no visible geometry collisions and that no
two characters could ever be identical.

This repo contains a few additional selections from the project as samples.

Thank you!
